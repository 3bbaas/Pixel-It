### Description
Pixel It is a lightweight C# WinForms image-editor that lets you apply filters-brightness, contrast, blur, oil-painting, negative, grayscale, metadata viewing/clearing, and more-to any bitmap. Itâ€™s perfect for quick, pixel-level edits without the weight of a full graphics suite.

> [!NOTE]
> For information about how it built, filters implemented, see the official Pixel It Documentation [FROM HERE](https://3bbaas.github.io/Pixel-It/).
